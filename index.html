        <p class="lead">Transport in South Korea is relatively simple.  Most signs and announcements are read out in English as well as Korean and you can always find a lovely stranger to help you out if you get stuck.  Most travel around the large cities is by the Metro which is very foreigner friendly and by far the cheapest and quickest way to travel.  For trips further afield, the high-speed trains are amazing and will get you there faster than the airport, but they can be pricey.  Buses can also be a good way of getting around as they are cheap.  However, most annoucements are read out in Korean so it can be difficult to know when your stop is.</p>

        <p class="blog-content">In the morning, head to Changdeokgung palace in Seoul, and remember to go via a hanbok shop to wear the traditional clothes and get free entry!  Then head to Gwangjang market to try the local delicacies of octopus, or if you're feeling less adventurous then eat some seafood pancakes.  Head out into the sun and eat your haul next to the Changdeokgung stream.  Once you're finished, walk upstream to get to the Bukchon hanok village where the small traditional lanes offer an insight into traditional life and have views of Seoul.  For dinner, catch the subway to the Han River and watch the sunset over the city whilst munching fried chicken and drinking beer.
